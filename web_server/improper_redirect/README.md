# Solution
~~This challenge is broken, flag is presented in the original 302 so no hacking is necessary~~
So this seems to have been the challenge itself, to see that content within 3XX
responses is usually not seen in user-agents. Problem of course here is that while testing
with Burp or other tools, you always see the content of 3xx reponses. Weak challenge, but 
not broken...
